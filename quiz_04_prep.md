#Wed, Oct 7, TCP Congestion Control, Ethernet Switching. 

###TCP congestion control
- Describe TCP Congestion Control.
- True/False. TCP slows down substantially when packets are lost.
- After TCP slows down from packet loss, what happens to the transmission rate when there is no longer any packet loss.
- True/False. The Control Window controls the transmission rate.
- What window controls the tramission rate? Where is this window contained?
- When packets are lost, the congestion window shrinks to about what size?
- Every round trip time, when no packets are lost, the congestion window grows by what?
- What other TCP mechanisms are used to lessen congestion?

###Ethernet switching True or False. Hubs take 1 bit at a time.
- True or False. Hubs broadcast everything.
- Why is an Ethernet switch sometimes called a "Learning Switch"?

###Network Address Translation
- What do TCP and UDP use to identify different applications on one computer?

- What combination uniquely identifies the socket and source computer?

###Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
